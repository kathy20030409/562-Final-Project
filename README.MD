# Cardiovascular Health Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project assesses multiple ML models' performance in predicting cardiovascular health outcomes using a national health survey dataset. We compare model effectiveness, considering accuracy and sensitivity, providing valuable insights for public health applications.

## Data Cleaning
Collected health-related data from 401,958 participants via phone surveys. Processed data using one-hot encoding for categorical variables and SMOTE for imbalance.

## LDA and Logistic Regression
Evaluated LDA and Logistic Regression models. Logistic Regression showed higher accuracy but lower sensitivity compared to LDA.

## Regularization
Implemented L1 and L2 regularization techniques to reduce overfitting and manage multicollinearity.

## Random Forest Analysis
Evaluated Random Forest model with 5-fold validation. Achieved good accuracy but low sensitivity, suggesting improvement opportunities.

## SVM Application
Applied SVM to CDC's 2020 health survey data. Explored four kernels with varying accuracy and sensitivity.

## Optimized Neural Networks
Utilized neural networks for heart disease prediction, optimizing sensitivity with Bayesian Optimization.
